# Ethereum Address Type Checker

The Ethereum Address Type Checker is a Geth application that allows users to determine the type of an Ethereum address, specifically distinguishing between smart contracts and externally owned accounts (EOAs). The application provides a simple HTTP server that responds with the address type and, for EOAs, the balance information.


## Features

- check the type of an Ethereum address (smart contract or EOA).
- Retrieve the balance of an EOA in Ether.
